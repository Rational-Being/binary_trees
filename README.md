In this repo, I willlearn about binary trees, most importantly I will write some code to this effect and learn the following too:
   
    What is a binary tree
    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
    What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
